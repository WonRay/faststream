FastStream

This project represents a proof of concept of compiling functional lambda abstractions into byte code.
That easily beats the standard implementation in java.util.stream.

The implementation is a generic query framework across common data structures such as array lists and hash tables.
And can, with a little work, be used as the basis of a query mechanism for in-memory databases of any form.  


Build Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites: Java 1.8 + Maven 3
> git clone https://github.com/faststream/faststream
> cd faststream
> mvn install
A single jar file will be built as faststream/target/faststream-xxxx.jar


Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently most of the functionality is limited by the public API that is still under development.

Basically streams are created by replacing usage of java.util.stream.Streams with io.faststream.FastStreams
~~~~
import io.faststream.*;

public static void main(String[] args) {
   System.setProperty("faststream.printAllToSystemOut", "true"); //Include this if you want to see generated code

   IntStream s = FastStreams.ofInt(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

   System.out.println(s.filter(e -> e % 2 == 0).mapToDouble(e -> e).sorted().sum());
}
~~~~

Another way of using it is by creating a custom array list implementation that automatically optimizes all calls to stream().
~~~~
import io.faststream.*;

public static void main(String[] args) {
   ListFactory<Integer> f = new ListFactoryBuilder().setPackage("com.acme").setClassLoaderParent(xxxxx).build();
   List<T> l = newArrayList();
   //Use it as an ordinary list    
}
~~~~


High level implementation overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) The user uses standard Java syntax for querying the data structure such as list.stream().filter(e -> e % 2 == 0).mapToDouble(e -> e).sorted().sum())
2) An intermediate representation of the query using operations such as Count, Distinct, Filter, Randomize, GroupBy, Sort, Map, Sum is created
3) The query is optimized, for example, by removing operations that do not effect the outcome of the query
4) A query plan is created using the properties of the underlying data structure, for example Fisherâ€“Yates shuffling can be used for array based structures.
   While it the shuffling method does not work to create truly random selections for link based hash table.
5) Java source code representing the query is generated and compiled internally using a modified Janino compiler. FastStreams uses Java representation as 
   an intermediate step instead of compiling directly to bytecode to ease the debugging process. In the future this could be replaced with direct compilation 
   based on an internal AST.
6) The compiled query is cached in a very efficient caching structure to allow for reuse if the same query is performed again.
7) The query is executed and the result is returned to user.

The simple query outlined in step 1 above is represented internally with this query object
~~~~
public class FilterMapToDoubleSortedSum extends Processor {

    public Object process(int[] arr, TerminalQueryOperationNode node) {
        // Original Query: C_FILTER->C_MAP_TO_DOUBLE->C_SORTED_NATURAL->CT_MATH_SUM
        // Simplified    : C_FILTER->C_MAP_TO_DOUBLE->CT_MATH_SUM
        
        // Extract all functions from a linked list of query objects
        SI_MapToDouble on = (SI_MapToDouble) node.previous().previous();
        IntToDoubleFunction mapper = on.getMapper();
        
        IntPredicate intPredicate = ((SI_Filter) on.previous()).getIntPredicate();
        
        double sum = 0.0d;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int e = arr[i];
            if (intPredicate.test(e)) {
                double mapped = mapper.applyAsDouble(e);
                sum += mapped;
            }
        }
        return Double.valueOf(sum);
    }
}

Benchmarks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The implementation is very efficient and most queries allocates less than a handful of objects. 

We have used the benchmarks outlined in Class of the Lambdas (https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6631).
Which is simple framework for testing lambda abstraction employed in stream processing across 
high-level languages that run on a virtual machine (C#, F# Java and Scala) and runtime platforms 
(JVM on Linux and Windows, .NET CLR for Windows, Mono for Linux).

We generally see a running time between 2 and 10 times faster than java.util.stream.
In addition to this the runtime variance is a lot smaller do to little object allocation.
For example, even simple operations such as counting the number of elements in an underlying stream
FastStreams.ofInt(1).count() vs IntStream.of(1).count(); (java.util.stream) is noticeable faster:

Benchmark                      Mode   Samples         Mean   Mean error    Units
f.StreamCompare.fastStream     avgt        10       15.943        0.275    ns/op
f.StreamCompare.intStream      avgt        10       41.732        0.527    ns/op

Tests where run using the JMH benchmarking framework (http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
