Provides different types of virtual views that can be used to query different data structures.
</br>

In FastStream all querying of data structures are done through creation of lightweight views.

One of the primary features of BigMap is extensive support for querying the data that is stored in the map.
Querying is done through creation of various virtual views.

Views are a central part in FastStream. They function as a read-only virtual view of group of objects.

 A (virtual) view is defined as a query against some kind of data. This is similar to how <tt>create view</tt> is used
in a SQL-based database to create a virtual table on top of a real table(s). These virtual tables does nothing at creation time
but only when they are further queried by the user. Unlike views in a database. The views in this package are really lightweight
and you can easily create millions of views simultaneously.
<p>

  No actually computation would take place when the view was created. Only when certain operations, for example
  {@link org.FastStreamframework.view.CollectionView#size()}, where invoked on the view a computation would take place. was called on the view. The view
  implementation would traverse all the elements in the list and test them against the specified predicate. Finally
  returning the number of strings in the list that where longer than 5 characters.

<h1>CollectionView</h1> A group of elements that can be ordered
<h1>MapView</h1>A group of unique keys mapping to a single value. The key-value pairs can be ordered
<h1>MultimapView</h1> A group of unique keys mapping to one or more values. The keys can be ordered as well as the values for each key

<h1>Various</h1>
<h3>Why is there no SetView or SortedMapView</h3>
The main design goal of the view package was to produce an API that was reasonably small, both in size, and, more importantly, in "conceptual weight".
The java.util package contains both a List, Set and Collection interface. The reason there is not also a ListView, SetView in addition to the CollectionView interface
is to keep the number of interfaces small. Consider, for example, MultiMapView which allows for both unique values, non-ordered values, and values that have an ordering.
If we were to go down the path of having a ListView and SetView in addition to CollectionView we would also need a MultiMapViewWithSetValues, MultiMapViewWithCollectionValues and MultiMapViewWithListValues interface.
